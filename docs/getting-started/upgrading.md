# Upgrading Your Plan

When your free trial ends (or whenever you are ready), upgrading takes about 30 seconds. Choose the plan that fits how you teach, and your account is reactivated immediately.

## The Plans

Loka offers three plans for educators, all powered by Stripe for secure billing.

### Loka Creator DIY -- $6/month

The essentials for independent educators who are comfortable managing their own setup.

- Scheduling and booking system
- Stripe payment integration
- AI features (bring your own API key)

Everything in DIY, plus hands-on help getting set up.

**Includes everything in DIY, plus:**
- Done-For-You initial configuration -- we set up your account, schedule, and booking page

## Additional Seats

As your practice grows, you can add more seats:

- **Educator Seat** -- $6/month per seat. Add team members who need their own dashboard, schedule, and Canvas.
- **Learner Seat** -- $6/month per seat. Automatically renewed when the learner pays for lessons. If a learner stops booking, their seat subscription stops too.

:::info Learner Seats Are Tied to Activity
Unlike educator seats (which are a standard monthly subscription), learner seats renew only when the learner pays for lessons. This means you are never paying for inactive learners.

## How to Upgrade

There are two ways to upgrade:

### From the Trial Banner

During your trial, a banner appears at the top of your dashboard showing how many days remain. Click the **Upgrade** button in the banner to go directly to the plan selection page.

### From Settings

1. Log in to your Educator Dashboard
2. Go to **Settings > Subscription**
3. Choose your plan
4. Enter your payment details (handled securely by Stripe)
5. Your account is upgraded immediately

## What Happens to My Data?

**Everything is preserved.** When you upgrade from a trial or switch between plans:

- All sessions and Canvas history remain intact
- Learner records and progress are kept
- Your schedule and availability settings carry over
- AI configuration and API keys are unchanged
- Analytics and reports continue uninterrupted

:::tip Switching Plans
You can upgrade or downgrade between plans at any time. Changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Your data is never deleted when switching plans.
