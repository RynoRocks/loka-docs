# Setting Up Your Schedule

Loka's scheduling system lets students book lessons based on your availability. Set your weekly hours, define constraints, and sync everything with your personal calendar.

## Setting Weekly Availability

To configure your recurring schedule:

1. Go to **Settings > Schedule** in your educator dashboard
2. Select the days you're available to teach
3. For each day, add one or more time slots (e.g., 9:00 AM -- 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM -- 6:00 PM)
4. Click **Save** to publish your availability

Students will only see open slots when booking through your school's booking page.

:::tip
Set your timezone in **Settings > Profile** before configuring your schedule. All time slots are displayed in your local timezone to students in theirs.

## Time Slots

You can set multiple time blocks per day. This is useful if you want to block out lunch breaks or reserve time for preparation:

| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Monday | 9:00 -- 12:00 | 14:00 -- 18:00 |
| Tuesday | 10:00 -- 12:00 | 13:00 -- 17:00 |
| Wednesday | -- | 14:00 -- 20:00 |

Slots that are already booked will automatically show as unavailable to new students.

## Schedule Exceptions

Need to take a day off or adjust your hours for a specific date? Use **Schedule Exceptions** to override your weekly pattern:

- **Block a date** -- mark a specific day as unavailable (holiday, personal day)
- **Modify hours** -- change your available times for a particular date without affecting your recurring schedule

Exceptions take priority over your weekly availability.

## Booking Constraints

Fine-tune how and when students can book with you:

### Advance Notice

Set the minimum lead time required before a lesson can be booked. For example, requiring 24 hours of advance notice prevents last-minute bookings that you can't prepare for.

### Cancellation Policy

Define how far in advance students must cancel to avoid being charged:

- **Flexible** -- cancel up to a few hours before
- **Moderate** -- cancel 24 hours in advance
- **Strict** -- cancel 48 hours or more in advance

Your cancellation policy is displayed to students at the time of booking.

### Buffer Time

Add buffer time between lessons to give yourself a break, review notes, or prepare for the next student.

## Calendar Integration

Loka syncs with your existing calendar so you never double-book:

### Google Calendar

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Connect Google Calendar**
3. Authorize Loka to read your calendar events
4. Events from your Google Calendar will automatically block those times in your Loka availability

### iCal Feed

For other calendar apps (Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.):

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Copy your **iCal feed URL**
3. Add it as a subscription calendar in your calendar app
4. Your Loka schedule will appear as read-only events

:::note
The iCal feed is one-way -- it pushes your Loka schedule to your calendar app. To block times based on your personal calendar, use the Google Calendar integration.

## Best Practices

- **Be consistent** -- students appreciate predictable availability week to week
- **Set realistic hours** -- account for preparation time, breaks, and admin work
- **Use exceptions early** -- block upcoming holidays as soon as you know about them
- **Review weekly** -- check your schedule every Sunday to confirm the week ahead looks right
