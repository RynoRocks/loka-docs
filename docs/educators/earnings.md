# Earnings & Payments

Loka tracks your teaching revenue and makes it easy to understand your earnings. View summaries, drill into details, and configure how you get paid.

## Viewing Your Earnings

Navigate to the **Management** tab on your dashboard to access your earnings overview. You'll find:

### Earnings Summary

A high-level view of your revenue for the selected period:

- **Total earnings** -- gross revenue from all completed lessons
- **Lesson count** -- number of sessions delivered
- **Average per lesson** -- your average earnings per session

Use the date range picker to view earnings for any period -- this week, this month, a custom range, or all time.

### Top Services

See which of your lesson types generate the most revenue:

- Service name and type
- Number of bookings
- Revenue per service
- Percentage of total earnings

This helps you understand which offerings resonate most with your students and where to focus your marketing.

### Top Students

View your highest-value students by:

- Total lessons booked
- Total revenue generated
- Average lesson frequency

## Earnings by Date Range

Filter your earnings data to analyze specific periods:

| View | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **This week** | Quick check on current week's activity |
| **This month** | Monthly revenue tracking |
| **Custom range** | Compare specific periods or prepare tax reports |
| **All time** | Full history since you joined Loka |

## Payout Configuration

Loka supports multiple payout methods so you can receive your earnings in the way that works best for you.

### Stripe Connect

Loka uses **Stripe Connect** for direct payouts:

1. Go to **Settings > Payments**
2. Click **Connect with Stripe**
3. Complete the Stripe onboarding process (identity verification, bank account details)
4. Once connected, lesson payments flow directly to your Stripe account

With Stripe Connect, payouts are processed automatically after each lesson payment. You can configure your payout schedule (daily, weekly, monthly) in your Stripe dashboard.

### PayPal

To receive payouts via PayPal:

1. Go to **Settings > Payments**
2. Enter your PayPal email address
3. Payouts are sent to your PayPal account on the configured schedule

### Wise (TransferWise)

For international educators, **Wise** offers competitive exchange rates:

1. Go to **Settings > Payments**
2. Enter your Wise account details
3. Payouts are sent in your preferred currency

:::tip
If you teach students across multiple countries, Wise typically offers the best exchange rates and lowest fees for international transfers.

## Loka Creator Subscription

To use Loka's teaching tools (Living Canvas, session management, AI features), you need an active **Loka Creator** subscription:

| Plan | Monthly Price | What's Included |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **14-Day Challenge** | $39 one-time | Entry-level introduction to the platform |
| **Loka Creator DIY** | $6/month | 1 Educator Seat + 1 Learner Test Seat |
| **Loka Creator DFY** | $29/month | Everything in DIY + Done-For-You configuration + 2hrs tech support |
| **Loka Creator Aspire** | $199/month | Everything in DFY + 2hrs founder-led coaching |

### Additional Seats

- **Educator Seat**: $6/month per seat -- for additional teachers in your school
- **Learner Seat**: $6/month per student -- renewed automatically with lesson payments

## Understanding the Billing Model

| Seat Type | How It's Billed | Auto-Cancel? |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Educator Seat** | Monthly Stripe subscription | No -- requires manual cancellation |
| **Learner Seat** | Renewed when learner pays for lessons | Yes -- stops when lessons stop |

This means your costs scale with your active student base. If a student takes a break, their seat cost pauses automatically.

## Tax and Reporting

Loka provides the data you need for tax reporting:

- Export your earnings history as a CSV from the Management tab
- Filter by date range to match your tax period
- All amounts are shown in your configured currency

:::note
Loka does not withhold taxes or provide tax advice. Consult with a tax professional about your obligations as an independent educator.
