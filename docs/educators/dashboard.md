# Dashboard Overview

The educator dashboard is your command center in Loka. From here you can launch lessons, manage students, track earnings, and access all your teaching tools.

## Dashboard Tabs

Your dashboard is organized into three main tabs:

### Canvas

The **Canvas** tab is where your lessons come to life. This is your gateway to the [Living Canvas](/educators/canvas) -- Loka's interactive whiteboard. From here you can:

- Start a new session with a student
- Review past session canvases
- Access saved notes, keywords, and Active Recall Pairs (ARPs)
- Export canvases as PDF or MP3

### Sessions

The **Sessions** tab shows your upcoming and past lessons:

- **Upcoming sessions** -- see what's on your schedule, with quick links to join or prepare
- **Past sessions** -- review completed lessons, student attendance, and session notes
- **Session history** -- filter by date range, student, or service type

### Management

The **Management** tab gives you oversight of the business side:

- Student roster and enrollment status
- Earnings summaries and payment history
- Service configuration (lesson types, pricing, duration)
- School settings and branding

## Key Metrics

At the top of your dashboard, you'll see at-a-glance metrics for the selected period:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Earnings** | Total revenue from completed lessons |
| **Lessons** | Number of sessions delivered |
| **Duration** | Total teaching hours logged |
| **Students** | Active learners in your school |

Use the date range picker to view metrics for any period -- this week, this month, or a custom range.

## Quick Access Features

- **Start Session** -- launch a new lesson directly from the dashboard (requires an active [Loka Creator subscription](/educators/earnings))
- **Calendar sync** -- your schedule integrates with Google Calendar and iCal
- **Notifications** -- booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment alerts appear in your notification center
