# Managing Students

Loka gives you a clear view of every learner in your school. Track their progress, review lesson history, and manage enrollments from a single place.

## Student List

Access your full student roster from the **Management** tab on your dashboard. The student list shows:

- Student name and profile photo
- Contact information
- Enrollment status (active, inactive, pending)
- Total lessons completed
- Last lesson date

Use the search bar to find students by name or email, and filters to narrow by status or activity level.

## Student Profiles

Click on any student to view their full profile. Each profile includes:

### Contact Information

- Name, email, phone number
- Preferred language and timezone
- Any notes you've added about their learning goals

### Learning History

A complete record of their journey with you:

- **Session log** -- every lesson with date, duration, and service type
- **Canvas history** -- all [Living Canvas](/educators/canvas) sessions, with notes, keywords, and CIPs
- **ARPs** -- their full library of [Active Recall Pairs](/educators/canvas#active-recall-pairs-arps) from past sessions
- **Progress trends** -- how their performance has changed over time

### Booking History

View all past and upcoming bookings:

- Lesson date and time
- Service type and duration
- Payment status
- Cancellation history

## How Learners Join Your School

There are several ways students can enroll:

### Booking Link

Share your school's booking page URL with prospective students. They can:

1. Visit your booking page
2. Browse your available services and time slots
3. Create a Loka account (or log in)
4. Book their first lesson and complete payment

The student is automatically added to your school roster after booking.

### Direct Invitation

Invite students directly from your dashboard:

1. Go to **Management > Students**
2. Click **Invite Student**
3. Enter their name and email address
4. They receive an invitation email with a link to set up their account

### Admin Assignment

If you manage multiple educators under one school, an admin can assign students to specific teachers through the admin panel.

## Learner Seats

Each active student requires a **Learner Seat** subscription. Key details:

- A Learner Seat costs $6/month per student
- The seat is renewed automatically when the learner pays for lessons
- If a student stops booking lessons, their seat subscription stops as well
- Students without an active seat cannot book new lessons

:::note
Learner Seats are tied to lesson payments -- you don't need to manually manage them. When a student books and pays, their seat stays active. When they stop, it naturally expires.

## Managing Student Records

### Adding Notes

Add private notes to any student profile to track:

- Learning objectives and goals
- Preferred teaching style or pace
- Topics to revisit in future sessions

These notes are visible only to you, not to the student.

### Reviewing Progress

Use the student's canvas history and ARP library to assess progress:

- Look at CIP trends -- are they making fewer errors over time?
- Review ARP mastery -- which recall pairs have they internalized?
- Check session frequency -- are they booking regularly?

### Deactivating a Student

If a student is no longer active:

- Their profile remains in your roster for record-keeping
- Past session data, canvases, and ARPs are preserved
- They can reactivate at any time by booking a new lesson
