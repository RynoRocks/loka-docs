# Welcome to Loka

Loka is a learning management system built for language educators who want to run their teaching business on their own terms. Whether you teach one-on-one conversation lessons, group classes, or anything in between, Loka gives you the tools to manage your students, deliver sessions, and get paid -- all from one platform.

## What Loka Does

- **The Living Canvas** -- A real-time, interactive whiteboard that turns every lesson into a living document. Capture corrections, vocabulary, and notes as you teach, then share them instantly with your learners.
- **The Living Textbook** -- Your corrections and teaching moments automatically build into a personalized textbook for each learner. No more lost notes or forgotten feedback.
- **Scheduling & Bookings** -- Learners book directly from your availability. Integrated calendar sync keeps everything in order.
- **Payments & Subscriptions** -- Stripe-powered billing handles lesson payments, seat subscriptions, and credit packs automatically.
- **AI Integration** -- Bring your own API key (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI) to unlock AI-powered lesson preparation, real-time suggestions, and post-session feedback.
- **Analytics & Progress** -- Track learner progress, session history, and teaching patterns over time.
