# Billing & Subscriptions

Loka uses a seat-based subscription model. You choose a Creator plan for your school, then add educator and learner seats as your school grows.

## Loka Creator Plans

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Loka Creator DIY** | $6/month | 1 Educator Seat + 1 Learner Test Seat. Self-service setup -- you configure everything yourself. |
| **Loka Creator DFY** | $29/month | Everything in DIY + done-for-you platform configuration + 2 hours of tech support per month. |
| **Loka Creator Aspire** | $199/month | Everything in DFY + 2 hours of founder-led coaching per month to grow your education business. |

All plans include full access to the Loka platform features: The Living Textbook, AI tools, booking system, progress tracking, and integrations.

### Free Trial

Not sure if Loka is right for you? Start with a [14-day free trial](/getting-started/free-trial) -- no credit card required. You get full access to all DIY features with 1 educator seat and 1 learner test seat. After the trial, upgrade to a paid plan to continue.

## Educator Seats

Each educator in your school needs their own seat.

- **Cost:** $6/month per educator seat
- **Billing:** Standard monthly Stripe subscription
- **Included:** Your Creator plan comes with 1 educator seat
- **Adding more:** Additional educator seats are purchased through Stripe checkout when adding new educators
- **Cancellation:** Manual -- you cancel educator seats when they are no longer needed

## Learner Seats

Each active learner also needs a seat, but learner billing works differently.

- **Cost:** $6/month per learner seat
- **Billing:** Automatically renewed when the learner pays for lessons
- **Auto-cancel:** If a learner stops paying for lessons, their seat is not renewed
- **No manual management needed:** Learner seats activate and deactivate based on lesson payments

This model means you are never paying for inactive learners. Seats scale naturally with your active student base.

## Billing Page

All payments are processed through Stripe. Access billing information from the **Billing** link in your profile dropdown (top-right header menu).

The billing page shows your current subscription status and seat information.

## Managing Subscriptions

### Changing Your Plan

To upgrade or downgrade your Creator plan, contact the Loka team. Plan changes can be arranged to take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

### Cancelling Your Plan

To cancel your Loka Creator subscription:

1. Go to **Billing** from your profile dropdown.
2. Click **Cancel Subscription**.
3. This sends a cancellation request to the Loka team, who will process it.
4. Your access continues until the end of the current billing period.

:::caution
Cancelling your Creator plan will deactivate all educator and learner accounts in your school after the current billing period ends.

### Adding or Removing Seats

- **Add educator seats:** Add a new educator from **Users > Manage LP** -- the seat subscription is created during the process.
- **Remove educator seats:** Cancel the educator's seat subscription from their profile in the admin panel.
- **Learner seats:** Managed automatically -- they activate on lesson payment and stop when lessons stop.
