# Billing & Subscriptions

Loka uses a seat-based subscription model. You choose a Creator plan for your school, then add educator and learner seats as your school grows.

## Loka Creator Plans

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Loka Creator DIY** | $6/month | 1 Educator Seat + 1 Learner Test Seat. Self-service setup -- you configure everything yourself. |
| **Loka Creator DFY** | $29/month | Everything in DIY + done-for-you platform configuration + 2 hours of tech support per month. |
| **Loka Creator Aspire** | $199/month | Everything in DFY + 2 hours of founder-led coaching per month to grow your education business. |

All plans include full access to the Loka platform features: The Living Textbook, AI tools, booking system, progress tracking, and integrations.

### 14-Day Challenge

Not sure if Loka is right for you? The **14-Day Challenge** ($39 one-time) is a guided introduction to the platform. You get 14 days to explore Loka with structured guidance, after which you can upgrade to a monthly plan.

## Educator Seats

Each educator in your school needs their own seat.

- **Cost:** $6/month per educator seat
- **Billing:** Standard monthly Stripe subscription
- **Included:** Your Creator plan comes with 1 educator seat
- **Adding more:** Purchase additional seats from **Admin Panel > Billing > Add Educator Seat**
- **Cancellation:** Manual -- you cancel educator seats when they are no longer needed

## Learner Seats

Each active learner also needs a seat, but learner billing works differently.

- **Cost:** $6/month per learner seat
- **Billing:** Automatically renewed when the learner pays for lessons
- **Auto-cancel:** If a learner stops paying for lessons, their seat is not renewed
- **No manual management needed:** Learner seats activate and deactivate based on lesson payments

This model means you are never paying for inactive learners. Seats scale naturally with your active student base.

## Stripe Billing Portal

All payments are processed through Stripe. You can access the Stripe billing portal from **Admin Panel > Billing > Manage Billing**.

From the portal, you can:

- View and download invoices
- Update your payment method (credit card, etc.)
- See your current subscriptions and their renewal dates
- View payment history

### Adding or Removing Seats

- **Add seats:** **Admin Panel > Billing > Add Educator Seat** (or add learners, and their seats activate automatically on payment).
- **Remove educator seats:** Go to the educator's profile and click **Remove Educator**. The seat cancels at the end of the billing period.
- **Remove learner seats:** Learner seats cancel automatically when the learner stops paying for lessons. No manual action is needed.
