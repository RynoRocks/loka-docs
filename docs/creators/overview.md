# Loka Creator Overview

A **Loka Creator** is the owner or administrator of a school on the Loka platform. As a Creator, you have full control over your school's setup, educators, learners, and billing.

## What Is a Loka Creator?

Think of the Loka Creator as the person who runs the school. You might be a solo language teacher managing your own business, or an academy owner overseeing a team of educators. Either way, the Creator role gives you the tools to manage everything from one place.

When you sign up for a Loka Creator plan, you get:

- Your own school instance on the Loka platform
- An admin panel to manage all aspects of your school
- The ability to add educators and learners
- Control over billing, settings, and integrations

## What You Manage

As a Loka Creator, you are responsible for:

### Educators
- Add and remove educators from your school
- Each educator gets their own dashboard with lesson tools, The Living Textbook, AI features, and student management
- Manage educator seats (each seat is a separate subscription)

### Learners
- Invite learners to join your school
- View learner progress, lesson history, and account status
- Manage learner seat billing

### Billing & Subscriptions
- Choose and manage your Loka Creator plan (DIY, DFY, or Aspire)
- Purchase additional educator and learner seats
- Access the Stripe billing portal for invoices and payment methods
- Monitor seat usage across your school

### Platform Settings
- Configure booking rules, timezone, and currency
- Set up integrations (Stripe, Zoom, Asana, and more)
- Customize email templates and notifications
- Configure white-labelling options

## Accessing the Admin Panel

After logging in, you will see the **Admin Panel** in your navigation menu. The admin panel gives you access to:

- **Dashboard** -- an overview of your school's activity, including active learners, upcoming lessons, and recent bookings.
- **Educators** -- manage your teaching staff and their permissions.
- **Learners** -- view and manage all learner accounts.
- **Billing** -- manage subscriptions, seats, and payment settings.
- **Settings** -- configure school-wide preferences and integrations.

:::tip
If you are also teaching lessons yourself, you can switch between the Creator (admin) view and the Educator (teaching) view using the role switcher in the navigation bar.
