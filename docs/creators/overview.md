# Loka Creator Overview

A **Loka Creator** is the owner or administrator of a school on the Loka platform. As a Creator, you have full control over your school's setup, educators, learners, and billing.

## What Is a Loka Creator?

Think of the Loka Creator as the person who runs the school. You might be a solo language teacher managing your own business, or an academy owner overseeing a team of educators. Either way, the Creator role gives you the tools to manage everything from one place.

When you sign up for a Loka Creator plan, you get:

- Your own school instance on the Loka platform
- An admin panel to manage all aspects of your school
- The ability to add educators and learners
- Control over billing, settings, and integrations

## What You Manage

As a Loka Creator, you are responsible for:

### Educators
- Add and remove educators from your school
- Each educator gets their own dashboard with lesson tools, The Living Textbook, AI features, and student management
- Manage educator seats (each seat is a separate subscription)

### Learners
- Invite learners to join your school
- View learner progress, lesson history, and account status
- Manage learner seat billing

### Billing & Subscriptions
- Choose your Loka Creator plan (DIY, DFY, or Aspire)
- Purchase additional educator seats
- View billing status and request changes

### Platform Settings
- Configure booking rules, timezone, and scheduling
- Set up integrations (Stripe, Zoom, Zoho Invoice, and more)
- Configure white-labelling options (school name, logo)

## Accessing the Admin Panel

After logging in, you will see the **Admin Panel** in your navigation menu. The admin panel gives you access to:

- **Users** -- manage educators (under "Manage LP") and learners (under "Manage Learners").
- **Settings** -- configure school-wide preferences, integrations, and booking rules.
- **Billing** -- accessible from the profile dropdown in the header. Manage your subscription.
- **Profile** -- update your admin profile and password, also from the header dropdown.

:::tip
If you are also teaching lessons yourself, the admin panel and educator dashboard are separate views accessed through different login credentials.
