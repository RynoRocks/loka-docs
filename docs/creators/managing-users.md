# Managing Educators & Learners

As a Loka Creator, you manage the people in your school -- both the educators who teach and the learners who study.

## Adding Educators

Each educator in your school requires an **Educator Seat** ($6/month per seat). Your Loka Creator plan includes one educator seat by default.

To add a new educator:

1. Go to **Admin Panel > Educators**.
2. Click **Add Educator**.
3. Enter their name, email address, and any initial settings.
4. The educator will receive an invitation email with a link to set up their account.

Once activated, the educator gets their own dashboard with access to:

- Lesson scheduling and The Living Textbook
- AI-powered lesson tools (ARP generation, assessment, feedback)
- Student management for their assigned learners
- Canvas and whiteboard tools

### Removing Educators

To remove an educator:

1. Go to **Admin Panel > Educators**.
2. Click on the educator's name.
3. Select **Remove Educator**.
4. Confirm the removal.

Removing an educator cancels their seat subscription at the end of the current billing period. Their lesson history and materials are preserved.

## Managing Learner Accounts

Learners join your school through an invitation or sign-up link.

### Inviting Learners

1. Go to **Admin Panel > Learners**.
2. Click **Add Learner** or **Send Invitation**.
3. Enter the learner's email address.
4. The learner receives an email with instructions to create their account.

### Learner Seats

Each active learner requires a **Learner Seat** ($6/month). Unlike educator seats, learner seats are renewed automatically when the learner pays for lessons. If a learner stops booking lessons, their seat subscription is not renewed.

This means you do not need to manually cancel learner seats -- they wind down naturally when a learner becomes inactive.

### Viewing Learner Details

From the learner management page, you can view:

- Profile information and contact details
- Lesson history and upcoming bookings
- Progress data and current level
- Seat subscription status
- Credit balance

## User Statuses

Users in Loka can have the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | The user has an active account and active seat subscription |
| **Pending** | The user has been invited but has not yet completed sign-up |
| **Inactive** | The user's seat subscription has lapsed or been cancelled |
| **Suspended** | The account has been temporarily disabled by the Creator |

You can filter the user list by status to quickly find the users you need.

## Verification

New users go through a verification process:

1. **Email verification** -- the user must confirm their email address by clicking a link in the welcome email.
2. **Profile completion** -- the user fills in required profile fields (name, timezone, etc.).
3. **Seat activation** -- the user's seat subscription is activated (either by the Creator or through payment).

Once all steps are complete, the user's status changes to **Active** and they can fully use the platform.

:::tip
You can resend invitation emails from the user's profile page if they did not receive the original invite or if the link has expired.
