# Pricing & Billing FAQ

Common questions about Loka's pricing, billing, and subscriptions.

---

### What does Loka cost?

Loka uses a seat-based pricing model. The **Loka Creator DIY** plan starts at **$6/month** and includes 1 educator seat and 1 learner test seat. Higher-tier plans (DFY at $29/month, Aspire at $199/month) include additional support and coaching. Each additional educator or learner seat costs **$6/month**.

---

### Is there a free trial?

Loka offers a **14-Day Challenge** for $39 (one-time). This gives you a guided introduction to the platform so you can explore all the features before committing to a monthly plan. It is not a free trial, but it is a low-risk way to evaluate whether Loka is right for your school.

### How does learner seat billing work?

Learner seats cost $6/month each, but they are renewed automatically when the learner pays for lessons. If a learner stops booking and paying for lessons, their seat is not renewed. This means you never pay for inactive learners -- seats scale with your active student base.

---

### How does educator seat billing work?

Educator seats are standard monthly subscriptions at $6/month each. Unlike learner seats, educator seats do not auto-cancel. You need to manually remove an educator seat when it is no longer needed. The cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.

---

### Can I change my plan?

Yes. You can upgrade or downgrade your Loka Creator plan at any time from **Admin Panel > Billing > Change Plan**.

- **Upgrades** take effect immediately, and you are charged the prorated difference.
- **Downgrades** take effect at the end of your current billing period.

---

### How do I cancel my subscription?

Go to **Admin Panel > Billing > Cancel Subscription**. Your access continues until the end of the current billing period. After cancellation, your data is retained for 90 days in case you decide to return.

Cancelling your Creator plan also cancels all educator and learner seats associated with your school.

---

### Can I get a refund?

Loka does not offer prorated refunds for partial months. If you cancel mid-cycle, you retain access until the end of your billing period. For the 14-Day Challenge, refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis -- contact support within the first 7 days.

---

### What payment methods are accepted?

Loka processes all payments through Stripe. You can pay with any major credit or debit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.). Additional payment methods may be available depending on your region.
