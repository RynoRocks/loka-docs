# Progress Tracking

Loka helps you see how far you have come and what to focus on next. Your progress is tracked automatically as you complete lessons, tasks, and assessments.

## Level System

Your language level is assigned by your educator and follows a structured progression. Levels are typically aligned with frameworks like CEFR (A1 through C2) or your school's custom level system.

Your current level is visible on your dashboard and determines:

- The difficulty of AI-generated review materials (ARPs).
- Suggested vocabulary and grammar points.
- Placement in group lessons, if applicable.

As you progress, your educator can update your level to reflect your growth. Level changes are logged so you can look back and see your journey.

## Structured Curriculum Levels

Some schools use Loka's structured curriculum feature, which organizes learning into defined stages. Each level includes:

- **Learning objectives** -- what you are expected to achieve at this level.
- **Required lessons** -- a set number of lessons or topics to complete before advancing.
- **Assessments** -- periodic checks to confirm readiness for the next level.

Your progress through the curriculum is shown as a progress bar on your dashboard. When you complete all requirements for a level, your educator can advance you to the next stage.

## Reward Points

You earn reward points for positive learning behaviors, such as:

- Completing lessons
- Finishing homework tasks on time
- Achieving milestones (e.g., 10 lessons completed)
- Consistent attendance streaks

Points accumulate over time and are displayed on your dashboard. Some schools use points to unlock rewards or recognition -- check with your educator for details.

## Credits

Credits are the currency you use to book lessons in Loka. Depending on your school's setup:

- **Credit-based booking** -- each lesson costs a certain number of credits. You purchase or receive credit packs, and credits are deducted when you book.
- **Subscription-based booking** -- your plan includes a set number of lessons per period. Credits may still be used for extra lessons beyond your plan limit.

You can view your credit balance on your dashboard. When credits are running low, you will see a reminder to top up.

## Badges

Badges recognize specific achievements and milestones. Examples include:

- **First Lesson** -- completed your first lesson on Loka.
- **Streak Master** -- attended lessons consistently for a set number of weeks.
- **Vocabulary Builder** -- reviewed a certain number of keywords.
- **Level Up** -- advanced to a new proficiency level.

Earned badges appear on your profile and dashboard. They are a fun way to see your accomplishments at a glance.
