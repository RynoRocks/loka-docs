# Booking Lessons

Loka makes it easy to find available time slots, choose a teacher, and book lessons in just a few steps.

## How to Book a Lesson

1. **Select a service** -- From your dashboard, click **Book a Lesson** and choose the lesson type (e.g., General English, Business English, Exam Prep). The available services depend on what your school offers.

2. **Choose a date and time** -- Browse the calendar to find open slots. Available times are shown in your local timezone. You can toggle between day, week, and month views.

3. **Select a teacher** -- Pick from the available teachers for your chosen time slot. Each teacher's profile shows their specialties, languages spoken, and a short bio.

4. **Choose a location type** -- Select how you want to take the lesson:
   - **Online** -- via Zoom or your school's preferred video platform
   - **In-person** -- at a physical location set by your school
   - **Hybrid** -- some schools offer both options for the same lesson

5. **Confirm your booking** -- Review the lesson details and click **Confirm**. You will receive a confirmation email with all the details, including any join links for online lessons.

## Booking Rules

Your school may have specific rules around booking. Common settings include:

- **Minimum advance booking time** -- e.g., lessons must be booked at least 24 hours in advance.
- **Maximum advance booking window** -- e.g., you can only book up to 2 weeks ahead.
- **Booking limits** -- some plans limit the number of active bookings you can hold at once.

If a slot is unavailable, it may already be taken or fall outside your school's booking window.

## Managing Your Bookings

You can view all upcoming and past lessons from the **My Bookings** section of your dashboard. Each booking shows:

- Date, time, and duration
- Teacher name
- Location type (online/in-person)
- Lesson status (upcoming, completed, cancelled)

## Cancelling a Booking

To cancel a lesson, open the booking details and click **Cancel**. Cancellation policies vary by school, but typical rules include:

- **Free cancellation** if done more than 24 hours before the lesson.
- **Late cancellations** (less than 24 hours) may still count as a completed lesson or incur a fee, depending on your school's policy.
- **No-shows** are generally treated the same as late cancellations.

Check with your school or educator if you are unsure about the cancellation policy.

## Group Lessons

Some schools offer group lessons where multiple learners attend the same session. When booking a group lesson:

- The available spots will show how many seats remain.
- You book your own seat individually -- you do not need to coordinate with other learners.
- Group lesson materials are shared with all participants after the session.
- Cancellation policies for group lessons may differ from one-on-one sessions.
