# Account Settings

Manage your profile, preferences, and security settings from the **Account Settings** page in your dashboard.

## Profile Management

Your profile contains the basic information visible to your teachers and school. You can update:

- **Display name** -- the name shown to your teachers and in lesson records.
- **Profile photo** -- upload a photo to personalize your account.
- **Email address** -- the address used for login and notifications. Changing your email requires re-verification.
- **Phone number** -- optional, used for SMS reminders if your school has them enabled.
- **Bio / About me** -- a short introduction that your teachers can see. This helps them tailor lessons to your interests and goals.

To update your profile:

1. Click your name or avatar in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Profile** or **Account Settings**.
3. Make your changes and click **Save**.

## Timezone Settings

Loka displays all lesson times in your local timezone. Setting this correctly is important to avoid booking confusion.

- Your timezone is detected automatically when you first sign up.
- You can change it manually in **Account Settings > Timezone**.
- All booking confirmations, reminders, and calendar entries will use your selected timezone.

:::caution
If your lesson times look wrong, the most common cause is an incorrect timezone setting. Double-check this before contacting support.

## Password Changes

To change your password:

1. Go to **Account Settings > Security**.
2. Enter your current password.
3. Enter and confirm your new password.
4. Click **Update Password**.

**Password requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number

If you have forgotten your password, use the **Forgot Password** link on the login page. A reset link will be sent to your registered email address.

## Notification Preferences

Loka sends notifications to keep you informed about lessons, materials, and account activity. You can control which notifications you receive:

### Email Notifications

- **Booking confirmations** -- sent when you book or cancel a lesson.
- **Lesson reminders** -- sent before upcoming lessons (e.g., 24 hours and 1 hour before).
- **New materials available** -- sent when your teacher publishes a lesson summary.
- **Task reminders** -- sent when you have incomplete homework tasks.
- **Account updates** -- password changes, email changes, and security alerts.

### Managing Preferences

1. Go to **Account Settings > Notifications**.
2. Toggle each notification type on or off.
3. Changes take effect immediately.

:::tip
We recommend keeping **Lesson reminders** and **New materials available** turned on. Timely reminders help you prepare for lessons, and reviewing materials soon after a lesson significantly improves retention.
