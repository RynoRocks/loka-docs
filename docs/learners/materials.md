# Lesson Materials & Recordings

After every lesson, Loka gives you a one-page summary of everything covered. Think of it as your personal textbook that grows with every session.

## Your One-Page Lesson Summary

Each completed lesson generates a summary page -- called a **Canvas** -- that captures what happened during the session. It includes:

### Canvas Notes
Your teacher's notes from the lesson, covering key discussion points, explanations, and anything written on the whiteboard during the session.

### Keywords & Vocabulary
New words and phrases introduced during the lesson, with definitions and example sentences. These are tagged to your level so you can review them in context.

### ARPs (Adaptive Review Phrases)
AI-generated review phrases based on the lesson content. ARPs help you practice what you learned by presenting the material in different contexts and sentence patterns.

### CIPs (Correct & Incorrect Phrases)
Corrections from the lesson, showing what you said alongside the improved version. Each CIP highlights the specific grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation point so you understand *why* the correction was made.

### Tasks
Any homework or follow-up tasks your teacher assigned. You can mark tasks as complete from your dashboard.

## Accessing Materials After Lessons

All your lesson materials are available from the **My Lessons** section of your dashboard. You can:

- **Browse by date** -- scroll through your lesson history chronologically.
- **Search by keyword** -- find specific topics or vocabulary across all your past lessons.
- **Filter by teacher** -- view materials from a specific teacher.

Materials are available immediately after your teacher completes the lesson summary. You will receive a notification when new materials are ready.

## PDF Downloads

You can download any lesson summary as a PDF for offline study or printing.

1. Open the lesson summary from **My Lessons**.
2. Click the **Download PDF** button.
3. The PDF includes all canvas notes, keywords, ARPs, CIPs, and tasks in a clean, printable format.

PDFs are useful for reviewing on the go or sharing with study partners.

## MP3 Audio

Loka can generate an MP3 audio file of your lesson content, powered by text-to-speech. This is helpful for:

- **Listening practice** -- hear correct pronunciation of keywords and phrases.
- **Review on the go** -- listen to lesson summaries during your commute or workout.
- **Reinforcement** -- hearing the material in addition to reading it strengthens retention.

To generate an MP3:

1. Open the lesson summary.
2. Click the **MP3** button.
3. The audio file will be generated and available for download or streaming.

:::tip
Revisit your lesson summaries regularly. Spaced repetition -- reviewing material at increasing intervals -- is one of the most effective ways to move knowledge into long-term memory.
